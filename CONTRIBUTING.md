# Contributing to Chunker

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Chunker repository.

If you find a bug in Chunker or wish to request adding a feature please make a GitHub issue, searching first to ensure
it doesn't exist already.

If you would like to contribute a fix or feature back to us, please make sure you keep it concise to just the feature /
bug. This ensures our team can properly review and test it. If you're unsure on your implementation feel free to open an
issue, and we can take a look.

# Out of Scope Changes / Features
We are unable to accept/merge changes that add features which are considered out of scope for the Chunker project, due to the commercial support contract that funds the ongoing in-time development of Chunker. If you are interested in adding/maintaining out of scope features, we suggest creating a fork of this project instead.

Out of scope features include but are not limited to:

- Entities (excluding paintings / item frames).
- Structure data (e.g. Villages / Strongholds).

We will reevaluate this list from time to time, and features may be added and removed from it at any time.
